> This article wraps up the "The dilemmas you'll face when creating a web component library" article series. If you haven't read the rest of the series, I'd recommend [starting at the introduction](/000-the-dilemmas-you'll-face-when-creating-a-web-component-library).

As your UI library grows, you'll find yourself up against new dilemmas and problems specific to your library. If you used this article series to help create your UI library, then please reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndricoKaroulla?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) with a link to your repo and I'll add it to the showcase in the article's GitHub repo.

If you want to learn more about UI library development, my recommendation would be to explore the code of your favourite UI libraries. If you're stuck for repos to look through, I've referenced my favourites throughout this series, so they're an excellent place to start. You can find links to all the resources I used for research in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andrico1234/web-components-resources).

If you're interested in being a part of the web component community, you can join the [Lit & Friends Slack](https://lit.dev/slack-invite) channel. Web developers from around the world share their work, ask for help, and give advice. In fact, folks like Westbrook Johnson ([Open WC](https://open-wc.org/)), Justin Fagnani ([Lit](https://lit.dev/)), and Serhii Kulykov ([Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/components)) all helped answer my questions when researching for this article.

If the discussion around standardising UI components piques your interest, you can get involved with the [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/).

## Thanks for reading

What started as a simple decision log for [oui-ui](https://oui-ui.netlify.app/) ended up becoming a lengthy article series, so thanks for reading if you've made it to the end.

I've tried my best to give good advice, but if you noticed any mistakes, or feel you've come across tools that better serve the problem spaces, then please reach out to me over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AndricoKaroulla?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). I'd love to make improvements to this series.
